## Models

The program automatically loads <br>
content from the models folder:

`/Models`

<br>

*In case you want to permanently change your setup to draw <br>
a different character, you just have to swap out those files.*

<br>
<br>

## Saving

**There's no save functionality.**

*Unless I need it or a lot of people request it,* <br>
*I won't sink time into developing the feature.*

<br>
<br>

## Positioning

<br>

1.  Place the popup window over your sketch

<br>

2.  Tweak your models:

    -   Translation
    
        <kbd>  Hold MouseWheel  </kbd>
    
    -   Rotation
    
        <kbd>  Hold RightClick  </kbd>
    
    -   Size
    
        <kbd>  Use MouseWheel  </kbd>
    
    <br>
    
    **Slider Range**  **⟷**  `360°`
    
<br>

## Recommended

As the translation slider adjusts the model in 3D space, <br>
it might mess up your rotation point, so it may be better <br>
to simply move the popup window itself.
